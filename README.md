Here's a ready-to-copy **README file** for your **Image Caption Generator using BLIP and Tkinter** project:

---

# 🖼️ Image Caption Generator (BLIP + Tkinter)

This is a Python GUI application that automatically generates a descriptive caption for an uploaded image using a deep learning model from Hugging Face (BLIP - Bootstrapped Language-Image Pretraining). The interface is built using Tkinter.

---

## 🔍 Features

* Upload any `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` image
* View the uploaded image in the app
* Automatically generates a caption using a pre-trained AI model
* Clean and minimal graphical interface (GUI) using Tkinter

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

* Python 3.8 or higher
* Required libraries:

  * `transformers`
  * `torch`
  * `pillow`
  * `tkinter` (included by default in most Python installations)

---

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone or download** this repository to your local machine.

2. **Install dependencies** using pip:

```bash
pip install transformers torch pillow
```

3. (Optional but recommended) Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

From your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
python ImgCaption.py
```

The GUI window will open. Click **“Upload Image”**, choose a file, and the AI will generate a caption for it.
